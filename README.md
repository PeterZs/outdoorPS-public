This code implements the algorithm introduced in 

Yannick Hold-Geoffroy, Jinsong Zhang, Paulo F. U. Gotardo, and Jean-Fran√ßois Lalonde, What Is a Good Day for Outdoor Photometric Stereo?, International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP), 2015. 

This implementation calculates and displays the confidence intervals from a set of HDR environment maps captured throughout a day. 

For more details, please see our project webpage: http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/projects/outdoorPS. 

*Important*: if you use this code, please cite the paper above!

Getting started
===============

Run the `main.m` script in `mycode`.

Make sure you have the environments maps and set the `datebasePath` flag to where the images located.

Running the code on your own images:

All you have to do is to specify `datebasePath` and `dateValue` it will automatic compute the confidence intervals for your data. 

Dataset
===========

See our [project webpage](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/projects/outdoorPS).
